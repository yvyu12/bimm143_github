## What is in the PDB database

The main repository of the bioinformatic structure info is the PDB database. <www.rcsb.com>

The database contains the following: 

```{r}
stats <- read.csv("Class10data.csv", row.names = 1)
stats
```

> Q1. What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-ray and Electron Microscopy?

Need to get rid of the commas to be able to convert to numeric. Can you find a function to get rid of the commas?

```{r}
x <- stats$X.ray
sum(as.numeric(gsub(",", "", x)))

```

I am going to turn this into a function and then use `apply()` to work on the entire table of data. 

```{r}
sumcomma <- function(x) {
  sum(as.numeric(gsub(",", "", x)))
}

sumcomma(stats$X.ray)
```

```{r}
ntotal <- sumcomma(stats$Total)
ntotal
```

```{r}
apply(stats, 2, sumcomma)
```

```{r}
apply(stats, 2, sumcomma) / sumcomma(stats$Total)
```

> Q2. What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
stats$Total <- as.numeric(gsub(",", "", stats$Total))

stats[1,"Total"]/sum(sumcomma(stats$Total))
```
86.7% of the structures are from protein only. 

> Q3. Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?


There is 248,805,733 entries found on the UniProt, compared to the 186,898 on the PDB protein entries, meaning that there is about ~0.075% that has identified. 

```{r}
(186898/248805733) * 100
```

## Visualizing the HIV-1 protease structure

Mol* ("mol-star") view is now everywhere. The homepage is: https://molstar.org/viewer/.

I want to insert my image from Mol* here. 

![My first molecular image](1HSG.png)

Here is an image of the targetted aspartic acid for Chains A and B, as well as the water molecule that has a strong interaction with the ligand and the chains.

## Working with the bio3d package

```{r}
library(bio3d)
```

```{r}
pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```
```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```
```{r}
pdbseq(pdb)[25]
```

## Predicting functional motions of a single structure

We can do a bioinformatics prediction of functional motions (i.e. flexibility and dynamics)

```{r}
pdb <- read.pdb("6s36")
pdb
```

```{r}
m <- nma(pdb)
plot(m)
```

Creates a file that can be visualized in molstar. 

```{r}
mktrj(m, file = "adk_m7.pdb")
```


# Comparative Analysis of Protein Structure

A complete pipeline of the analysis would be written through for a given protein family starting from a single database ID for a member of this family all the way to a deeper understanding of structure, dynamics, and function. 

```{r}
library(bio3d)
```

```{r}
id <- "1ake_A"

aa <- get.seq(id)
aa
```

```{r}
b <- blast.pdb(aa)
```

```{r}
hits <- NULL

hits$pdb.id <- c('1AKE_A','6S36_A','6RZE_A','3HPR_A','1E4V_A','5EJE_A','1E4Y_A','3X2S_A','6HAP_A','6HAM_A','4K46_A','3GMT_A','4PZL_A')
```

```{r}
#Download the PDB related files, saves it in the pdbs files
files <- get.pdb(hits$pdb.id, path="pdbs", split=TRUE, gzip=TRUE)
```

```{r}
# This would align the files that were downloaded
pdbs <- pdbaln(files, fit = TRUE, exefile="msa")
```

Print out the alignment. 
```{r}
pdbs
```

```{r}
#Perform PCA
pc.xray <- pca(pdbs)
plot(pc.xray)
```
```{r}
# Conducted to visualize the PC1 
pc1 <- mktrj(pc.xray, pc=1, file="pc_1.pdb")
```
